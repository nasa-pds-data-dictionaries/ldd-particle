# Builds

A Local Data Dictionary (LDD) is built for each version of the [PDS4 Information Model](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/doc/im/).
The build process insures compatiblity of the LDD with the core information model.

This LDD has been built for the following versions of the PDS4 information model.

- [1.4.0.0](build/1.4.0.0)
- [1.7.0.0](build/1.7.0.0)
- [1.8.0.0](build/1.8.0.0)
- [1.9.0.0](build/1.9.0.0)
